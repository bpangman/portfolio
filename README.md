# Pangman Portfolio

## Purpose
To start sculpting my portfolio page for future freelance work. I'll be honest, this isn't close to being done... but I'm getting there! I'd like the opportunity to keep working on this assignment and potentially get a higher grade, just worries about not submitting anything just yet.
